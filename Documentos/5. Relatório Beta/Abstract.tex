\chapter*{Abstract} \label{abstract}

Nowadays with the constant evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), it would be expected that basic day-to-day tasks would be under these technologies. Such an advance would minimize the time wasted by people in activities that can be carried out by machinery. By automating the collection of data related to the stocks of products at home, we simplify the management of stocks. In this way, we help users to keep the stock adequate to their needs, as well as to alert them to the proximity of the product term. Thus, our work is aimed at answering questions such as: ``In what way can we avoid inconveniences caused at the time of refueling our storages? Or how to control stockpiles of food and other products? How to prevent outdated items?". If we understand that our house functions as a company, where there are people who can perform the same tasks, e.g., go shopping following a prepared list, we enable any member of the family to carry out the purchase.\\
